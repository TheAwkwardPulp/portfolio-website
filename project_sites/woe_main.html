            <h2>About this Video</h2>
            <p>
                This video was the culmination of several months of sporadic research 
                into various modes of entertainment and the Biblical symbolism hidden 
                in plain sight.  The object, of course, is to point out the deep roots 
                all of this symbolism has in various works of fiction and how it ties 
                to the progression of Bible prophecy in real life.<br><br>
                
                For the duration of my years in High School, I invested my soul into 
                learning more about my fictional interests, theorizing about them, and 
                writing about them.  It was not until I graduated that I realized the 
                serious damage this had done to me socially, emotionally, intellectually, 
                and spiritually.  Though I professed to be a Christian, I had nothing to 
                show for my faith other than a faulty claim that the things I was working 
                on would one day show people that the end of this world was very near.<br><br>
                
                After reading the book <i>The Great Controversy</i> at the crossroads of 
                a long spiritual journey, I came to a decision that would alter the trajectory
                of my life forever.  I could pursue God with greater zeal and power, or I 
                could continue to live with my fictional attachments as I had been: placing 
                myself at the center of attention and wallowing in self-pity and depression 
                that I had brought upon myself.  One or the other had to go.<br><br>

                Obviously, I made the latter decision, and doing so opened my eyes to the 
                patterns of Biblical symbolism in my own writing and in the works of others. 
                The reason this was so significant to me was because none of the symbolism was 
                ever intended, nor did I believe it to be by anyone else.  And yet, it was so 
                stark a fact that I had to dig deeper to find a common theme.  That common theme 
                led me to the creation of this video and to my current belief that all of fiction, 
                contemporary and ancient, has some message from Satan himself about the conflict 
                he is engaged in with Christ.<br><br>

                I understand that idea is radical.  But if you will humor me, please allow me to 
                share my findings.  Satan's plans are elaborate, convoluted, woefully undetected.  
                But we have nothing to fear in Christ.  "What shall we then say to these things?  
                If God be for us, who can be against us?"  Romans 8:31.
